        <h4>Dear web developer,</h4>
        <p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a top secret web
            app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three languages are the primary
            <span class="blurred">foundations</span> of the web, upon which everything
            else is built.
        </p>
        <p>HTML and CSS are used to build the <span class="blurred">structure</span> of a
            web page and style it, with fonts, colors, background colors, padding, borders
            and margins.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is run in the web browser. It is
            used to make web pages more interactive, as well as to modify the content of
            the inner HTML. JavaScript listens for <span class="blurred">events</span>
            such as button clicks and mouse overs.
        </p>
