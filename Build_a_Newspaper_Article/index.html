            <p class="text">It's time to break out the barbeques and sparklers, it's the 4th of July! Many businesses
                are closed today so that their employees can light up the charcoal briquettes and watch the meat sizzle
                on the grill!</p>
            <p class="text">Today started off with some early morning rainshowers to cool things down. There are
                scattered afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast, but the skies in the evening should clear up nicely,
                just in time for the Independence Day fireworks celebrations to light up the night. Grab your sweetheart
                and a blanket, relax on the riverfront, and enjoy the show!</p>
