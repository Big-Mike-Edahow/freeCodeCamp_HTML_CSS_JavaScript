                <h2>Gear Up</h2>
                <p>When a trucker is going to spend weeks on end out on the road, the proper
                    gear is essential. A sleeping back, sheets, and pillows and pillowcases can
                    make the sleeper bunk of a truck feel like home. A hard hat, safety vest,
                    steel toed boots, and leather gloves keep a driver safe, and allow them to
                    access job sites where personal protection equipment is required. Bottled
                    water by the case is a must, as it's too expensive to buy water by the
                    bottle a truckstop.</p>

                <h2>Considerations</h2>
                <p>Air fresheners will give the truck that new car smell. Armorall Wipes will
                    help protect the dash and give it a glossy shine. A bottle of Windex and
                    some paper towels to clean windows will reduce sun glare.</p>
